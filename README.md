# Form-Sign-Up
A standard Sign-Up form for any standard webpage with an imaginary service. For this project had creative freedom to get fonts, colors, images etc. I chose to stay in theme of Spooktober and skeletons. Dancing Skeleton is just an imaginary service for desk plants. I continued to use colors you'd find on candy corn in theme of Fall and Halloween. 

#### Tasks and Functional Goals
Was given a general design to follow. HTML and CSS to set up a dummy page and content. The main focus of this project was to get the sign-up form to look and act how you would expect. Javascript was implemented to validate the form as well.
